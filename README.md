# YA-TEST

## Task

Develop a C/C++ module (library) for a block memory allocator. This allocator should allow memory allocation of a fixed-size block (one by one) from a static pool (pool in static memory). The sizes of the block and the pool are fixed during the programâ€™s execution but should be configurable during the project build process. The module must be adapted to work on embedded platforms of various bit widths in a multitasking environment (RTOS). The module should have a set of unit tests (covering two or three basic cases is sufficient).

Conditions requiring clarification should be interpreted at your discretion, and a corresponding comment should be left in the solution (preferably in the form of a comment in the source code files). Comments should only use Latin letters.
